        <div class="ps-info-paragraph">Hello there! My name is Samson and this is my first year Engineering Portfolio at UofT. Firstly, I would like to apologize for the lack of aesthetic perfection on this website. I have always wanted to learn how to build my own website using HTML and CSS so I decided that learning something I am interested in was the best way to motivate myself to start and finish early (and I was right). My position in context video is linked beside this paragraph and the projects are linked below. Feel free to click into them for more information and pictures!!! I hope you enjoy reading this portfolio as much as I enjoyed making it. If you want to check out the process of making this website, make sure to check out the website project listed below.</div>
