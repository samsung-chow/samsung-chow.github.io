          <div class="explanation-1-paragraph">This website is the culmination of around 15 hours of learning and 35 hours of coding. One of my biggest regrets this year in praxis was not putting in any effort for the position statement. Seeing other peoples position statements during lectures made me realize how little creativity I used this year in all of my projects. I have always wanted to learn how to code a website from scratch and saw this portfolio as my opportunity and excuse to learn it and get some practice. I would like to give a very big thank you to my best friend <span><a class="priscilla" href="https://instagram.com/priskilla_.c?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=" target="_blank">Priscilla</a></span> who helped me a bunch with the visual layouts and aesthetics. The images on the left are all linked to their relevant websites, so I encourage you to hover over them to check out the caption and click if you want to learn more about them.</div>

          <div class="explanation-2-paragraph">Like I mentioned in the position statement, I am a person who likes to learn by doing and this project is no different. I found a 6 hour course on youtube and thoroughly learned the content throughout about one week. However, I only really started to understand all of the syntax and what it does when I started to code my own website. Even though this project took a lot longer than I initially expected, I have produced something that I am proud of and I think this process was totally worth it. I love how this project reinforced my idea of giving everything a try. It was definitely a steep learning curve as I was busy with other academics, but in the end I am happy with the result.</div>

          <div class="explanation-3-paragraph">This project has really taught me that I do have the ability to self learn. Going through covid and being surrounded by distractions during classes, I often found myself struggling with learning online. I think this project has revealed to me that my learning style changes from being in person to being online. I have always thought that the in person connection with a professor could not be replaced online due to the distance and the lack of physical eye contact, but I believe that this course has taken a step in the right direction with the “follow along” style approach. I am hopeful that I will find the time to continue improving this website and to be able to explore even more different types of online learning as I believe it is imminent in the future.</div>

            This photo shows an early design iteration of the website layout for the main page. My first step when creating a new page is always to figure out how to layout the stuff. At this stage, I have only learned grids and flexboxes so a lot of my stuff is very similar to a grid style.
