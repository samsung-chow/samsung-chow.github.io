          <div class="explanation-1-paragraph">The CIV102 final bridge project was nothing like I had expected. I fully remember expecting to be building popsicle stick bridges like I had seen other engineering classes do online. Instead, each group was given 1 sheet of matboard, which resembled slightly thicker cardstock, and was then tasked with completely designing a proper cross section, and having all necessary calculations to back up our design. At first I was completely lost but with the help of my teammates we were able to design a bridge that tied for top 3 in our tutorial group!!! Our teams bridge was able to withstand around 700N of force before the splice connections failed.</div>

          <div class="explanation-2-paragraph">The Civ bridge project was my very first team project (not including praxis) and I specifically remember feeling lost and having to deal with thinking that I wouldn’t be able to contribute. I was not the best at civil engineering. However, I learned that I could try to incorporate my programming skills in assisting the team and ended up overseeing the packing code among other things. Once again, I found that all I needed to do was jump into this project and learn by doing. We ended up doing quite well and this project definitely helped towards my final exam grade. </div>

          <div class="explanation-3-paragraph">I think one of my main takeaways from this project was that I do belong here, I do belong in engsci. Throughout the entirety of the first semester, I was extremely worried that I was not smart enough or I should’ve never been accepted in the first place. However, after going through this project and seeing all of my peers on about the same page as each other, it made me realize that being smart enough is not the sole reason why people are in engsci. Seeing my peers help me when I was confused about something and also being able to help other groups struggling made me realize that this is where I want to be. This is an environment that I love and one that I will work hard to stay in.</div>

            This is a photo of a moment just before our bridge failed. It failed at almost 700N and I still blame it all on Raymond. It was definitely Raymonds fault. Jokes aside, the main cause of failure of this bridge was the splice connection.

            This is a photo of the output of a packing program that was used to help layout where to cut. This was extremely significant in the process of making sure not to waste matboard and being able to fit all the pieces on the matboard.
