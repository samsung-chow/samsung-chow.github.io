          <div class="explanation-1-paragraph">The <span><a class="rsx" href="https://www.instagram.com/rsx.utoronto/?hl=en" target="_blank">Robotics for Space Exploration (RSX)</a></span> Hackathon was our very first hackathon. Our team of 4 consisted of Kristin Mark, Maria Betty, Preetinder Signh, and myself. We thought that this was one of the best hackathons as a start since Maria and I were interested in coding and Kristin and Preet were interested in the electrical hardware components. The main objective of this hackathon was to build a robot that tracked a black line on the ground through various twists and turns. Our team, named the “Roblox Warriors” placed third place overall out of 30 teams!!! It was a major success, and a lot of fun being able to learn and work with my best friends.</div>

          <div class="explanation-2-paragraph">I think that this hackathon was another prime example of my learning style preference. Going into this hackathon, there were 4 lectures online that were youtube videos but I felt as though I knew nothing and was pretty scared of letting my friends down. However, as the hackathon progressed, Maria and I started getting better at figuring out how to code the bang bang algorithm that ultimately made it to the end of the course! I really feel like this hackathon was when I truly discovered how much faster I could learn things when I had a hands-on learning experience, and it has changed my approach on new projects ever since. I am no longer reluctant to start new unknown projects and dive into a different learning process.</div>

          <div class="explanation-3-paragraph">Since our hackathon was only about 8 hours, I do not believe that we gained a lot of experience and knowledge on Arduino and robotics. However, this hackathon has taught me that having hands-on experience while learning new materials drastically changes the learning experience and process. I truly wish that I can one day find or develop methods to learn tough subjects such as calculus and linear algebra with a more hands on approach. This hackathon has changed my preferred learning style and I will be forever grateful to RSX for providing me with this opportunity and experience.</div>

            This is a photo our little robot named "Bobina". We used IR sensors as the guidnace system and had an Arduino Uno board as the brains. Bobina was one of the only few robots who made it to the end of the track.

            This photo shows Maria and I trying to figure out how to code our robot. We are in the process of learning what each function does, how to read pin states, and how to write to pins. It is very similar to our work in UTAT so we learned fairly quickly.
