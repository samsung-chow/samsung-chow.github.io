          <div class="explanation-1-paragraph">One of my biggest regrets this year in praxis was not putting in any effort for my position statement. Seeing other peoples position statements during lectures made me realize how little creativity I used this year in projects. As such, I wanted to take this opportunity to express my creativity and learn a new skill in the process. This is my very first website, I bought the domain, learned everything off of youtube and had my best friend <span><a href="https://instagram.com/priskilla_.c?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=" target="_blank" class="priscilla">Priscilla</a></span> help with some of the visual layouts and aesthetics. I thoroughly enjoyed learning by doing and even though this project took a longer time than expected, I still think it was worth it.</div>

          <div class="explanation-2-paragraph">This project took a total of around 50 hours to complete - 15 for learning the material and about 25 for coding the entire website. As an addition to my position in context, I think that this project has made me realize the potential of self learning especially for coding related material. There are a lot of great resources online and learning HTML and CSS through building this website was a great test of my skills to self learn. I also think that this project serves as the best example of backing up my position in context. I am a person who learns things by doing and I intend to continue learning more and continue making improvements to this website.</div>

          <div class="explanation-3-paragraph">Again, I think this project really taught me that I have the ability to self learn, and that there are plenty of excellent resources out there on the internet. However, I have also learned that I personally prefer learning from a professor or a lecturer. I think that nothing can replace that feeling of having a connection with your lecturer or professor who is standing at the front of the room. I am really curious if there are ways to build that personal connection through online learning courses and how that potentially affects the online learning model. As the summer approaches, I am hopeful that I will find the time to continue improving this website and to be able to explore different types of self learning whether it be through learning websites, books, or even more youtube videos.</div>
