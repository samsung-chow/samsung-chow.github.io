          <div class="explanation-1-paragraph"><span><a class="ew" href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/foundation-years/praxis/" target="_blank">Praxis</a></span> is definitely a course that requires no introduction. This semester, our team initially wanted to explore the lack of feminine hygiene products for extended outdoor activities, but decided to move on with the firefighting RFP instead. The standpipe kit is a 20 pound bag that firefighters must carry with them during missions. We noticed that the strap of this bag tended to slip off a lot causing disturbances to the firefighters and even posing injury risk as the bag was very heavy. In turn, we redesigned the bag through a long engineering design process and the product is shown in picture 3. This redesigned bag features a new attachment system with the goal of reducing swinging motion and slipping.</div>

          <div class="explanation-2-paragraph">Our final design prototype is called the “Stop, Pop, and Drop” (SPD). This design is an enhancement to the current design as the additional components can simply be added to the existing standpipe kit. The SPD features a 3 point harnessing system with quick release buckles which significantly reduces the time required to unequip. Moreover, the bag has velcros which attach the bag to the leg or hip of the individual. This mechanism prevents swinging and thus directly targets one of the biggest problems. While this specific prototype is not up to NFPA standards, our next steps include research on said materials and creating a higher fidelity prototype.</div>

          <div class="explanation-3-paragraph">Praxis two is definitely the course that really got me thinking about who I am as a person and who I am as an engineering student. This semester, I feel like I really enjoyed working alongside my team members Justin, Alyssa, and Vanessa primarily because we all shared one very important value: Fun. We all agreed that praxis is never about getting high marks and being the best of the best. For us, it was always about having fun with your team and learning how to work with other engineering students. Our team put a heavy emphasis on psychological safety and I believe it really paid off. Maybe my take on this is all wrong, but I am still thankful that I got to come to this understanding alongside the best group of likeminded people in my praxis group.</div>
