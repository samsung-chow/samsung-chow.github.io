          <div class="explanation-1-paragraph"><span><a class="ew" href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/foundation-years/praxis/" target="_blank">Praxis</a></span> is definitely a course that requires no introduction. This semester, our team initially wanted to explore the lack of feminine hygiene products for extended outdoor activities, but decided to move on with the firefighting RFP instead. The standpipe kit is a 20 pound bag that firefighters must carry with them during missions. We noticed that the strap of this bag tended to slip off a lot causing disturbances to the firefighters and even posing injury risk as the bag was very heavy. In turn, we redesigned the bag through a long engineering design process and the product is shown in picture 3. This redesigned bag features a new attachment system with the goal of reducing swinging motion and slipping.</div>

          <div class="explanation-2-paragraph">Praxis two is definitely the course that really got me thinking about who I am as a person and who I am as an engineering student. This semester, I feel like I really enjoyed working alongside my team members Justin, Alyssa, and Vanessa primarily because we all shared one very important value: Fun. We all agreed that praxis is never about getting high marks and being the best of the best. For us, it was always about having fun with your team and learning how to work with other engineering students. Our team put a heavy emphasis on psychological safety and I believe it really paid off. </div>

          <div class="explanation-3-paragraph">If I am being honest, I completely failed the first position statement because I really had no idea who I was and what I thought about engineering design. I used to think it was about the product. However, throughout this year it has become pretty obvious to me that engineering design is all about the process - it's all about the steps that you took to get to the final product. Praxis one drilled FDCR into our brains, but I think engineering design is more than just that. To me, it's all about understanding who you are and who your peers are and why you made the decisions that you made. Maybe my take on this is all wrong, but I am still thankful that I got to come to this understanding alongside the best group of like minded people in my praxis group. </div>
