          <div class="explanation-1-paragraph">During Praxis one, our team addressed the issue of a lack in current portable coin sorting solutions. One of the main reasons for today's transition into a cashless world is because of the inefficiency and inconvenience of change and their storage. In order to address that, our team designed the coin sorting shaker machine, which uses the vibrations of walking to automatically sort your coins. Shown on the left is a prototype that was brought to Alpha (it was rotated to fit onto the screen). This prototype was built out of a used pringles can and 3d printed layers for the sorting mechanism.</div>

          <div class="explanation-2-paragraph">The sorting mechanism was based off of the lego head sorting machine. With each layer having smaller holes, larger currency is filtered at the top and smaller currencies such as dimes and pennies would fall to the bottom. Each layer was 3d printed to the exact size of each coin such that each layer would sort one type of coin specifically. Additionally, this design featured an automatic sliding door for coin insertion and an automatic sliding door for coin removal as well. The goal of this design was to eliminate the inconvenience of everyday coin usage.</div>

          <div class="explanation-3-paragraph">I will be honest here, Praxis is a course that I was originally very skeptical of. I failed the midterm with 38%. I even met with one of the professors who told me that they would have given me a lower mark. I will admit to the fact that I was naive and thought that I was not going to learn anything, but praxis has actually been the course that has taught me the most about who I am as an engineering student. While the professor's words were harsh, they revealed the reality that I had not put in any effort in taking the course seriously. Thus, I decided to approach praxis with an open mindset and finished the course with a B+, scoring 74% on the final exam.</div>
